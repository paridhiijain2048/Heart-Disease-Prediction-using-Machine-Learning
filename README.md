### Heart Disease Prediction Project

Heart disease prevention is crucial for improving public health and ensuring that more people lead healthy lives. Machine Learning (ML) plays a pivotal role in predicting heart diseases with high accuracy, enhancing the overall research and prevention processes.

#### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a heart disease patient dataset with comprehensive data processing. Multiple ML models were trained, and predictions were made using various algorithms to determine the presence of heart disease. The project was implemented using Python, primarily in a Jupyter Notebook, and shared as a Kaggle kernel titled *"Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras."*

#### Objective
To build a data-driven system capable of accurately predicting heart disease using a range of ML algorithms, and to evaluate their performance.

#### Dataset
- **Source**: [Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
- **Description**: The dataset includes several health-related parameters as features and a binary target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

#### Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
1. **Logistic Regression** (Scikit-learn)
2. **Naive Bayes** (Scikit-learn)
3. **Support Vector Machine (Linear)** (Scikit-learn)
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors** (Scikit-learn)
5. **Decision Tree** (Scikit-learn)
6. **Random Forest** (Scikit-learn)
7. **XGBoost** (Scikit-learn)
8. **Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden Layer** (Keras)

#### Model Performance
- The models demonstrated varying levels of accuracy in predicting heart disease.
- **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy of **90%**, making it the most effective model for this dataset.

#### Conclusion
This project showcases how ML can significantly contribute to healthcare by providing accurate predictions for heart disease. By utilizing different algorithms, the project not only compares their performance but also emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making in medical research and prevention.
